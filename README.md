## About

This project was created as part of a 3-day long, remote Hackathon hosted by FallIn.

The event hosted in April 2021 brought together veterans and others in tech from across the world to learn, explore, and work on solving the problems faced by service members and veterans. Checkout FallIn or Operation Code for more great opportunities for veterans looking to join tech.

## TEAM

### Target Audience

Active Duty Service Members and Veterans

### Problem We are Solving

There are so many resources, key events, and references it is easy for service members and veterans to be late for or miss key timelines for significant career events (separation, PCS, etc.). By allowing users to create template checklists, with resources, to interactively track their key events and share with others, we can ensure our service members and veterans donâ€™t miss out.

### Idea

A tailored resource created specifically for service members and veterans to help them to automatically track key the steps of key career events.

## Technology

- Frontend: React, Next.js
- Backend: Serverless Functions (Node.js), MongoDB
- Other: Next-Auth, Formik, Styled-Components
